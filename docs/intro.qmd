## Problem Statement:
The goal of this final project is to explore the national parks species data set given and answer some questions about the data. Data relating to national park species can allow us to answer questions regarding threatened and endangered species patterns, nativeness and ecological integrity, species richness and biodiversity composition, and park area and species density. There will be exploration for all of the columns given for this data set within this report.

## Why should the audience be interested:
This research is important and interesting because it is foundational for understanding what species are in each park and to understand more about the species. It also provides information on whats occurring within our environment.

## Addressing the Problem Statement:
After cleaning the data we plan to visualize a lot of these questions as well as taking statistical benchmarks. We also plan to use regression to analyze variables like species and parks.

## Explaining how the analysis will help consumer:
This analysis will allow others to understand the relationships between species and national parks and give insight into the statistics that make up the data generated by our community.

## Assumptions:
The results we get could be biased based on the type of species that are collected in the dataset. The species in the dataset might not be the full representation of all those species in the respective national parks.
